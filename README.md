## About

**Compact Raid and Party** (CRAP) is a World of Warcraft (1.12) add-on that replaces the default party and raid frames with a more compact group frame.

Features:
- Can be repositioned and resized
- Heal prediction
- Range check
- [Clique](https://github.com/Lexiebean/Clique) click-casting support
- Basic customization via the `/crap` in-game command
